Unix Shell
# Overview
Implemented a command line interpreter (CLI) or, as it is more commonly known, a shell. The shell operates in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished. The shells is similar to, but simpler than, the one we run every day in Unix.
The shell can be invoked with either no arguments or a single argument; anything else is an error.
implemented exit, cd, and path as built-in commands.
